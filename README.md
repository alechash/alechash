__[ABOUT ME]:__ I am a recent high school graduate taking computer science at a community college. I taught myself Lua in middle school and have ever since constantly been teaching myself and expanding my knowledge when it comes to any type of software or hardware. I am currently working on several apps in my free time as well as trying to build a startup that brings language barriers in communication and on the internet to an end. To keep myself sane I also love photography and I competitively power lift!
